Things I was playing with in my early days :). The interesting parts are found under "mystuff/Java/Side Projects/". These side projects are what got me into Siemens. 

**Note**: There seems to be a small bug in the GUI of Minesweeper. This wasn't the case before. I imagine it has to do with the fact that I had a different Java version at the time, and the three years of Java updates can lead to bugs if the code is not maintained.
