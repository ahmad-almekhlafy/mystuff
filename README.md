Things I made in my free time three years ago. They are what got me into Siemens. I am a better programmer today, of course :).

**Note**: There seems to be a small bug in the GUI of Minesweeper. This wasn't the case before. I imagine it has to do with the fact that I had a different Java version at the time, and three years of Java updates can lead to bugs if the code is not maintained, apparently.
